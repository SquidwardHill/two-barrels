                <li>I'm teaching myself Vue.js, so this has been a more practical application of my learnings thus far. Because the game is my own brain child, I didn't just follow along with a tutorial like a zombie.</li>

            <!-- <li><strong><em>Overview</em></strong></li> -->

            <li>After deciding on how the game should work, I wrote out a rough draft of the game logic, and considered the structure of the application. I used the Vue CLI for project scaffolding-- then set up the routes, views, and components I decided on.  </li>
           
            <li>The majority of the game data and logic is set up in the Home view component. Here, all of the game's reactive data properties are initialized in the component's data object.</li>

            <li>In order to start the game, the user clicks the "roll die" button. The button uses the <span class="code">v-on</span> directive, which accepts <span class="code">RollDie()</span> method. Within this method, the value of the <span class="code">roll</span> property is updated, and the <span class="code">turnsRemaining</span> property is decremented. </li>
           
           <li>
              In order to communicate to the parent Barrel component that the child's "add to barrel" button has been clicked and to therefore update the total, I used Vue's built in <span class="code">$emit</span> method to pass up the name of the event.
           </li>

           <li>The parent Barrel component listens for the event emitted, which triggers the appropriate update methods, followed by a series of checks to compare values and determine whether the game should continue running.</li>

           <li>If <span class="code">turnsRemaining > 0</span>, the roll is reset and the game continues to run. Else, the barrel totals are compared to determine a win or a loss and the Modal component is triggered. </li>

           <li>The outcome is passed as a prop to the child Modal component, and the close button triggers the <span class="code">$emit</span> method - which the parent listens for and calls the <span class="code">ResetGame()</span>  method.</li>

           <li>Fin. üëè</li>

          <p><strong>Blockers | Future</strong></p>

          <p>The thing I found most challenging during this project was state management and determing the pattern I wanted to work with. Because its a fairly small and simple game- I went with the most straight forward option (to me) that I could complete most efficiently.</p>

          <p>Improvements I would like to make include refactoring the project to include an event bus, and potentially breaking it down into even smaller, building block components. Based on the specific job description, I should probably make this in Ruby next.</p>

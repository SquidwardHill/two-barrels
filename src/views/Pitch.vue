          <p>If given the chance and allowed the resources and support, <strong>I'll work my ass off to be the best employee I can be</strong>. I've been primarily self taught over the years, and the idea of working in a dedicated software environment where (a degree of) mentorship is provided sounds like a dream. ðŸŒˆ </p>
   
          <p>Reading through the Two Barrel website, I feel like I get you. Yeah, I'm referring to the company website as some sort of sentient being. I shed a tear scrolling through the "how we work" section. But in all seriousness, <strong>the company seems awesome, a culture I can see myself a part of and a place where the employees are valued and well taken care of</strong>.  </p>
    
          <p>Additionally, <strong>I want to work in a dedicated software/development environment that is stable</strong>. I started down my path as junior web designer turned front end developer on a team of two at a local marketing agency. I learned by fire, and on my own. Everyone's jobs depended on the agency's capability for client growth and retention. Every year at Christmas, there were lots of cuts, and bonuses for those who stayed on. There were a lot of things I loved about my job- primarily that I had a great boss who let me try tons of new things and inspired me to care fiercely about my work. But after 3+ years at a marketing agency shelling out customized Wordpress sites and a small taste of software development, he decided to chase bigger dreams, and shortly after I did as well. </p>
     
          <p><em>Why this path?</em> Making things is fun! I enjoy solving problems, learning new things, and pushing my own boundaries. I relish writing code and then getting to see it in action or come together as part of the puzzle. What a cool thing to call a job.</p>

          <p><em>To note:</em></p>
          <p>Yes, I do currently live in Chattanooga, TN. However, I would love a reason to move out to Washington. (I've been intentionally looking for jobs in the area).</p>
